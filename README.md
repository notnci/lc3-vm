# lc3-vm
a short vm to run lc3 assembly

This was mainly a project for myself a while back to understand how a RISC vm would work 
(trying to understand virtualization in software such as vmprotect). I added some comments
in there to explain how the different parts of each instruction build the parameters of the
operation. Hopefully someone finds this helpful; I also linked the tutorial I used in the comments of the file for anyone that's curious.
